## Reading pairs

| Pair | Computed ratio | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Background / Text | 21.00:1 | Normal-size text contrast threshold met |
| Background / Case label slate | 8.07:1 | Normal-size text contrast threshold met |

Ratios use WCAG relative luminance in sRGB. They test flat color pairs, not every rendered component. Use 4.5:1 for normal-size text and 3:1 for large text or meaningful non-text boundaries where applicable. Do not put information in color alone. For translucent layers or imagery, check the actual composited result.

The source palette is preserved; percentage usage, CMYK and Pantone equivalents are not inferred. Convert for the actual printer and paper profile, then proof. Accent colors that fail reading contrast remain decorative or need a tested background.
